# Contributing

There are two branches: master and dev. I would prefer adding features in the dev branch, and fixing in the master branch.

You can contribute by:
- Merging both branches
- Fixing errors (bugs, grammar, license, etc)
- Testing using other tools (Different JS runtimes, Different versions/variants of MySql, etc.)
